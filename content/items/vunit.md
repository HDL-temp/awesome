*"VUnit is an open source unit testing framework for VHDL/SystemVerilog \[...\]  It features the functionality needed to realize continuous and automated testing of your HDL code. VUnit doesn’t replace but rather complements traditional testing methodologies by supporting a “test early and often” approach through automation."*
