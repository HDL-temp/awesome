*"OpenCores is the most prominent online community for the development of gateware IP (Intellectual Properties) Cores. It is the place where such cores are shared and promoted in the spirit of Free and Open Source collaboration."*

*"The OpenCores portal hosts the source code for different digital gateware projects and supports the usersâ€™ community providing a platform for listing, presenting, and managing such projects; together with version control systems for sources management."*

- In 2015, the core active users of OpenCores established the independent *FOSSi Foundation*, who creates [LibreCores]({{< ref "/items/librecores" >}} "LibreCores").
- [Free Range Factory](https://freerangefactory.org/cores) collects several IP-cores from OpenCores and other sources.
