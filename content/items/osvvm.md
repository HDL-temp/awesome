*"OSVVM is an advanced verification methodology that defines a VHDL verification framework, verification utility library, verification component library, and a scripting flow that simplifies your FPGA or ASIC verification project from start to finish. Using these libraries you can create a simple, readable, and powerful testbench that is suitable for either a simple FPGA block or a complex ASIC."*

*"OSVVM is developed by the same VHDL experts who have helped develop VHDL standards. We have used our expert VHDL skills to create advanced verification capabilities that:*

- *Are simple to use and work like built-in language features.*
- *Maximize reuse and reduce project schedule.*
- *Facilitate readabilty and reviewability by the whole team including software and system engineers.*
- *Facilitate debug with HTML based test suite and test case reporting.*
- *Provide continuous integration (CI/CD) support with JUnit XML test suite reporting.*
- *Provide buzz word features including Constrained Random, Functional Coverage, Scoreboards, FIFOs, Memory Models, error logging and reporting, and message filtering.*
- *Rival the verification capabilities of SystemVerilog + UVM."*
