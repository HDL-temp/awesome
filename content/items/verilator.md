Verilator is "the fastest free Verilog HDL simulator". From a verification
perspective it supports *line coverage*, *signal toggle coverage* and limited
specification of *functional coverage* using SystemVerilog Assertions.
It also allows one to write testbenches in C++ or SystemC.

- Written In: C++
- Write testbenches in: C++/SystemC
- Supports: Design simuation, *Coverage collection from simulations*.
