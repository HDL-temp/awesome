*"Edalize is a Python Library for interacting with EDA tools. It can create project files for supported tools and run them in batch or GUI mode (where supported)."*

*"All EDA tools such as Icarus, Yosys, ModelSim, Vivado, Verilator, GHDL, Quartus etc get input HDL files (Verilog and VHDL) and some tool-specific files (constraint files, memory initialization files, IP description files etc). Together with the files, perhaps a couple of Verilog defines, some top-level parameters/generics or some tool-specific options are set. Once the configuration is done, a simulation model, netlist or FPGA image is built, and in the case of simulations, the model is also executed, maybe with some extra run-time parameters."*

*"The thing is, all these tools are doing this in completely different ways and there's generally no way to import configurations from one simulator to another."*

*"Dread not! Edalize takes care of this for you. By telling Edalize what files you have, together with some info, what parametrization to use at compile- and run-time (e.g. plusargs, defines, generics, parameters), VPI library sources (when applicable) and any other tool-specific options not already mentioned, it will create the necessary project files and offer to build and run it for you."*
